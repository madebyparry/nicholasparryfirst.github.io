        <h3>Hey there !</h3>
          <p>So here's how it went: I was 16 years old and debated what I wanted to go to school for. I was between ASL-Interpreter and Graphic Design. I went with the first one, spent 4 years in school, and graduated. I think you get where that led... I went back to school and ended up still doing graphic design! I guess you can take the artist away from the art but you can't take the art away from the artist?</p>

        <h3>What has shaped who I am today ?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The family business. I grew up living on a campground and rollerena. I learned from a young age to be flexible, stay positive in any work environment, and to work like you own the business. I am very social and enjoy making people laugh.</li>
            <li>Where I grew up. Growing up in the middle of nowhere with a tiny tiny population has helped to keep me flexible. Without a lot of options of things to do, you have to get creative!</li>
          </ul>
