      <h3>Evil like this can't even have a name</h3>
      <p>In 1933, three hybrid dolphins beached off the Irish coast; they were hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose dolphins.[16] This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring. A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California. Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose-Atlantic spotted hybrid.[19] The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid. Two wolphins currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false killer whale and a female bottlenose. Wolphins have also been observed in the wild.</p>

    <h2 id="anatomyHead">Anatomy</h2>
        <p> Dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. <b>Boom</b>, roasted.</p>

      <h3>Integumentary System</h3>

        <p> See, doesn't that sound made up? I mean listen to that word, <i>intengumentary...</i> Is that even pronouncable? I mean if you were to go and make a fake ass little name for your fake ass animal you think they'd end up calling it something a little more plausibe.</p>
      <h3>Blubber</h3>
        <p>All dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.</p>
